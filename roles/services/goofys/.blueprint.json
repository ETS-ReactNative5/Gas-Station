  "role_description_full_overview": "[Catfs](https://github.com/kahing/catfs) allows you to have cached access to another (possibly remote) filesystem. Caching semantic is read-ahead and write-through. [Goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys) is a high-performance, POSIX-ish Amazon S3 file system written in Go, which allows you to mount an S3 bucket as a filey system. It's a Filey System instead of a File System because goofys strives for performance first and POSIX second. Combining catfs and goofys (and possibly a fast internet connection), you can mount a folder that is automatically synced with an S3 bucket that is also performant.",
