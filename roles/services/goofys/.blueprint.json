Catfs allows you to have cached access to another (possibly remote) filesystem. Caching semantic is read-ahead and write-through. Goofys is a high-performance, POSIX-ish Amazon S3 file system written in Go, which allows you to mount an S3 bucket as a filey system. It's a Filey System instead of a File System because goofys strives for performance first and POSIX second.",
