Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)—an open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others—and deploys it to a web server.",
