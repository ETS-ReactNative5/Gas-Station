UPX will typically reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus reducing disk space, network load times, download times and other distribution and storage costs. It supports compressing a wide variety of binary-like files. Surprisingly, it even compresses executables better than WinZip. Best of all, it is free and open source.",
