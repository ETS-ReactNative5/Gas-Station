It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. [Kompose](https://kompose.io/) is a conversion tool for Docker Compose to container orchestrators such as Kubernetes (or OpenShift). [Helm](https://helm.sh/) helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application. [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), which is also included in this role, is a local developement tool that allows you to test Kubernetes stacks on your personal computer.",
